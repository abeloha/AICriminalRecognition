### abeloha: AICriminalRecognitionSystem python app for managing criminal records using AI.

This is a python project for managing criminal records. It uses image recognition libraries to train the system with a folder of images of a criminal. The system can then recognise that same criminal by his/her photo and pull his/her records from the database. 

The project uses python for back-end, PyQt5 is used for User Interface, and SQLite is used for database.
